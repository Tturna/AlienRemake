# Action wrappers
# All wrappers should return a function that returns a string representing
# the result of the action. The inner function should take the core game object as an optional argument.
# The wrapper should take the calling player and an optional target player as arguments.
# If the arguments to the wrapper are fucked, it should return a string telling the user what's wrong.

# The point of wrappers is to initialize players with data such as if they are hiding or not.
# They return an inner function that is called at the end of the action phase.
